# GRC Security Study Plan

## Introduction into GRC

GRC is an initialism that denotes Governance, Risk, and Compliance, but the reality is much more. GRC is the integrated collection of capabilities that enable an organization to reliably achieve objectives, address uncertainty, and act with integrity.

- Governance & Oversight provides methods to guide, constrain and conscribe the organization to achieve its purpose, mission, vision, and values.
- Strategy & Performance provides methods to guide, arrange and operate resources to achieve objectives and monitor performance.
- Risk & Decision-Support provides methods to identify and address the eî€‡ect of uncertainty on objectives, including ways to support decisions under uncertainty.
- Compliance & Ethics provides methods to identify and address mandatory and voluntary obligations and the underlying ethical principles and values.
- Security & Continuity provides methods to identify and address threats to critical physical and digital assets and infrastructure.
- Audit & Assurance provides methods to enhance confidence that the organization is reliably achieving objectives, addressing uncertainty, and acting with integrity.

But for the scope of this study plan we will focus on the following elements:
- Governance & Oversight
- Risk & Decision-Support
- Security & Continuity
- Audit & Assurance

### Capabilities


### The 101 on "GRC"
>  The easy way of understanding GRC: 

```
#### G = People
  - People are the ones who commit misconduct and make mistakes and miscalculations.

#### R = Wicked Problems; Complex Adaptive Sytem of Systems
  - Wicked Problems - describe a complex, dynamic, and multifaceted problem that is
    difficult or even impossible to solve completely. 
  - Complex adaptive system of systems - is a type of system that is made up of many
    interacting subsystems, each with its own behavior, rules, and feedback loops.

#### C = Fractality
  - Fractality refers to the property of self-similarity or the repetition of patterns
    at different scales in a system or structure.
```



### GRC Model

### Measuring GRC

#### The Boring Way

- Level 1 - Initial. Practices are improvised, ad hoc, and often chaotic.
- Level 2 - Managed. Practices are defined and managed, though sometimes informally.
- Level 3 - Consistent. Practices are formally documented and consistently managed.
- Level 4 - Measured. Practices are measured and managed with data-driven evidence.
- Level 5 - Optimizing. Practices are consistently improved over time.

#### My Personal Way

- Crawl
- Walk
- Run
