# Common Skills for Cybersecurity Study Plan

Whichever domain you choose in Cybersecurity umbrella like Application Security, Cloud Security or DevSecOPs; there are common skills which one must learn to excel in this domain.
I have explained [what you need to learn in those common skills here](https://github.com/jassics/cybersecurity-skills-career-roadmap/blob/master/common-skills.md)

So, I will explain from where to study and how much time you should devote to learn those concepts in these common skills, so that you are job ready and interview ready too!

**These 5 common skills are:**

1. -[ ] [Linux](#linux-basics-and-linux-commands) (1 week)
2. -[ ] [Networking](#networking-fundamentals) (1 week)
3. -[ ] [Programming](#programming-skills) (2 weeks)
4. -[ ] [Cloud Computing Fundamentals](#cloud-computing) (2 weeks)
5. -[ ] [git commands](#git-commands) (1 week)

## Linux basics and Linux Commands (1-2 weeks)
It should not take more than a week to be comfortable with basic linux commands to do day to day activities.
Once you are comfortable with basic command, go fo networking and other security related command in little depth.

Bug bounty hunters, Penetration testers and almost all tech focused security professionals use O.S. like Kali Linux, Parrot OS or BlackArch Linux which have lots of security tools to play with.
But for that you would need to know the basic working of Linux and commands.

### Some common commands I can think of are:
- ls, 
- cd, 
- cp, 
- scp, 
- cat, 
- uname, 
- less, 
- more, 
- sort, 
- ssh, 
- mv, 
- du, 
- df, 
- mount, 
- mkdir, 
- who, 
- locate, 
- chmod, 
- chown, 
- sudo, 
- top, 
- kill, 
- grep, 
- find, 
- sed, 
- awk, 
- ps, 
- zip, 
- tar, 
- service/systemctl

What else you can think of as common linux commands for everyone?

### Beyond basics commands for security professionals (mainly AppSec and Pentesters) are:
1. netcat
2. nslookup
3. host
4. dig
5. netstat
6. traceroute
7. nmap
8. nikto
9. fierce
10. dirb
11. install/uninstall/update/upgrade
12. find 
13. grep
14. ifconfig
15. learn basics of regular expression as well.
16. start and stop services
17. basic understand of /opt /tmp and log, server locations
18. comfortable in running scripts written in various languages like python, ruby, go etc.
